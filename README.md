# movie_recommendation_system
This project aims to build a recommendation model based on spark MLlib to predict movie ratings and perform analysis on the movie-lens dataset. It is an ALS implementation of matrix factorization method.
The Machine learning technique used is broadly classified as Collaborative filtering.
The Movie-lens dataset is randomly split into training and testing datasets.
Training dataset is used to iteratively run and analyse trendss in movie ratings based on certain latent factors.
Test dataset is considered as user input to the model and is used to make furthur predictions on it.
